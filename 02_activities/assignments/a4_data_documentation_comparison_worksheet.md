However, only 25 of the faecal samples (66%) contained solid insect material suitable for molecular analysis.                                                                                          |
| Target population                                     |    Canadian residents aged 15 and older, focusing on contributors to volunteering, charitable giving, or civic participation.

| Survey mode(s)                                        |   electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing).                                                                                         | The survey was conducted in two modes: telephone (RDD) and online.                                            |   The data collection involved direct fieldwork and observational methods. Mist nets were used to capture bats, and molecular analysis was performed on guano samples collected from the captured bats.                                                                                          |

| Response rate                                         |  24,000 out of 40,000 invitation letters (~60%).                                                                                          |          RDD: 5.6% for the campaign-period survey; PES: re-interview rate was 72%; online survey: re-interview rate for post-election survey was 27.3%                                   |  isn't directly applicable, but of the 112 bats caught, 38 faecal samples were obtained.

| Weights                                               |  Base weight (WGHT_PER) for analysis at the person level. Adjusted weights to account for rejective sampling and match income distributions from other sources. Bootstrap weights for variance estimation.                                                                                          |Weights were applied to the online survey data based on age, gender, education, and province census distributions. The telephone survey also used weights, incorporating factors like the type of phone line (wireless vs. landline).                                             |  study did not mention specific weights applied to the data during analysis (such as for sample weighting or survey adjustments).                                                                                           |
| Data processing                                       |   Generalized processing system (SSPE) used to ensure data quality; Automatic and manual edits at various stages; CATI system integrated real-time error detection and correction.                                                                                         | Data was pre-processed by cleaning out incomplete responses, respondents who completed the survey too quickly, or provided inconsistent or incorrect information (e.g., postal codes mismatching their province).                                            |  DNA sequences were edited using Sequencher v.4.5 and aligned in BioEdit v.7.0.9. A neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA v.4.                                                                                           |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |   Extensive imputation for missing data using donor records and score functions; Mean imputation for unresolved cases.                                                                                         | Data cleaning included removal of the respondents who: took the survey twice, answered demographics or the core survey incompletely, completed the survey in less than 8.5 minutes, “straight-lined” responses to multiple grid questions, provided postal codes inconsistent with their province.                                            | Data cleaning involved aligning DNA sequences and verifying species identifications by comparing them to reference sequences in the Barcode of Life Data System. No imputation techniques were mentioned for missing or incomplete data, although some insect species could not be conclusively identified due to reference limitations.                                                                                            |
| Sources of error                                      | Sampling error, non-response bias, and coverage error.                                                                                           | sampling errors, relatively low response rate could introduce nonresponse bias, measurement error, coverage error.                                            |  Potential sources of error include incomplete or uncertain species identifications due to the lack of matching reference sequences for some insect DNA fragments.                                                                                           |
| Limitations, known biases                             | Over-representation of tech-savvy individuals in online surveys; social desirability bias affecting responses about charitable behaviors.                                                                                           | mode bias, response bias, nonresponse bias, demographic bias.                                            | Limitations include potential biases in the prey detection model due to the use of thresholds derived from a temperate moth species (Noctua pronuba), which may not fully reflect the auditory thresholds of the tropical moths consumed by Glossophaga soricina. Additionally, the inability to obtain clear species identifications for all insect fragments could limit the completeness of the dietary analysis.                                                                                            |
