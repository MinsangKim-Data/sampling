# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

   At first glance, the sample is likely representative because it focuses on entry and lower-level employees with less than two years of tenure, which aligns with the group experiening high turnover. But there are many unavailable information of how the sample was collected that may affect the quality of your sample being representative of the population.

   1. The sample size must be large enough to reduce sampling error and capture variability within the population.
   2. Coverage error: If sampling frame is incomplete, such as missing employees who have left already, the result maight not capture the full perspective.
   3. Non-response bias: Employees who are dissastified might not respond or respond falsely, which will create potential bias.
   4. Sampling bias: If certain departments or demographics within the target gropu are underrepresented, the findings might not generalize across the company.

   

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. 

    1. How satisfied are you with your current role at the company? (1 to 5)
    2. Do you feel there are enough growth opportunities at the company? (1 to 5)
    3. How likely are you to recommend the company as a good place to work to others? (1 to 5)
    4. What aspects of your job do you find most challenging or unsatisfactory?
    Compensation and Benefits
    Work-Life Balance
    Career Development Opportunities
    Team and Management Support
    Job Responsibilities and Challenges
    Company Culture
    5. How often do you receive constructive feedback and recognition for your work? (1 to 5)
    6. How long do you see yourself staying at the company if no changes are made to your current work  environment? (0 to 5 years)

**Revised Survey:**

1. How satisfied are you with your current role at the company? (1 = Very Dissatisfied to 7 = Very Satisfied)
2. Do you feel there are enough growth opportunities at the company? (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree)
3. How likely are you to recommend the company as a good place to work to others? (1 = Not at All Likely to 7 = Extremely Likely)
4. What aspects of your job do you find most challenging or unsatisfactory? (Choose all that apply)
Compensation and Benefits
Work-Life Balance
Career Development Opportunities
Team and Management Support
Job Responsibilities and Challenges
Company Culture
Other: __________
5. How often have you received constructive feedback and recognition for your work in the past six months? (1 = Never to 7 = Always)
6. How long do you see yourself staying at the company if no changes are made to your current work environment? (0 to 5 years)
7. What department do you work in? (Optional: Helps identify patterns in responses)

Reasoning for changes: These changes improves clarity, reduces ambiguity, and captures more nuanced and actionable data, improving survey quality. In addition, the answer scale is changed to 1 to 7 to give more options for moderate satisfaction levels. Add "other" option with space for the respondent to give free space to capture unlisted or unsatisfactory aspects that are not mentioned. Specified a more recent time frame in Q5 for feedback and recognition to improve response quality. And for Q7, I included a question about demographics (department) to help identify patterns across subgroups while maintaining anonymity.



3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

No, for the purpose of our survey, an observational study would not have been appropriate or enough for finding out the reasons for high turnover. Observational studies are useful for tracking behaviors or patterns but not the reason for why the high turnover exists. To find out some insights or reasons for high turnover, we need a more directed survey to glean some input as to why people are leaving. 

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
